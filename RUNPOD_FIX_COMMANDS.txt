# Copy-Paste These Commands on RunPod to Fix the Issue

# After you push updated code to GitHub:

cd /workspace/NewProject
git pull origin main
bash startup.sh

# That's it! The updated code will now work with transformers 4.45.0

# If git pull doesn't work, do manual update:
# 1. Copy the 3 updated files from local to RunPod:
#    - download_models.py
#    - s2s_pipeline.py  
#    - requirements.txt
# 2. Run: bash startup.sh
